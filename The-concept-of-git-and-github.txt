  Git is a distributed version control system,
  as a contrast to for example subversion that
  is centralized. What this means is that with
  subversion, the code repository repo lives
  on a server and people need special permissions
  commit rights to be able to add code to the repo.
  Everything lives in one place.

  GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration
  platform for software developers GitHub facilitates 
  social coding by providing a web interface to the Git 
  code repository and management tools for collaboration.
  GitHub can be thought of as a serious social networking
  site for software developers.
